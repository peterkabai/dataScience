## Things We Will Review

- Basic data science
- Classification, regression and clustering
- KNN
- R coding

## The Basics

- What do we want to make good predictions on?
- Training or test data? Why?
- What happens if our model is too specific to the training data?
- What about if it doesn't fit the training data enough? 
- What is a feature? What about a feature space?

## Classification

- We're trying to predict a label, or category.
- This is supervised learning, we know the label of each training example, that is, what category it belongs to.
- Example: given information about credit card debt, we try to predict whether or not the person defaulted on their debt.
- What could some possible target features be categories be?
- If the data shows the output to be 1 or 0, is that correct? Aren't numerical features for regression?
- What is an example of something that cannot be the output of a model that does classification?

## Regression

- Here we're trying to predict a numerical output.
- This is supervised learning, we know the value of the target feature for each training example. 
- Example: given the engine size, transmission type, and vehicle weight, predict the mpg.
- What are other possible target features of a model that uses car data?
- What are features that would not be target features in a regression problem?

## Clustering

- Here we're grouping data together into any number of categories.
- Unsupervised learning, we give the model some data, and it finds similarities on its own.

## KNN

- KNN can be used for both regression, and classification.
- In KNN classification the output is the most frequent label of the K closest points.
- In KNN regression the output is the mean of the K closest points.

# R Coding!

## Vectors {.build}

```{r, echo = TRUE,}
# There are no scalars! This expression is equal to 1
length(5)

# The function length() returns the number of items in a vector
# All item in a vector must be the same type

# If they aren't the lower types get converted to the higher type
c(1, 2, "three")
```

## Sampling {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# Sampling is a way to create a vector with random values
sample(1:10, 100)

# This fails, because there are only 10 options, 
# but we're trying to pick 100.
# To fix it, we can set replace to TRUE
```

## Sampling {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
sample(1:10, 100, replace=TRUE)

# We can also simply add the TRUE parameter.
sample(1:10, 100, TRUE)
```

## Sequences {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# There are multiple ways to do write parameters for sequences.
seq(from=1, to=10, by=2)
seq(1, 10, 2)
```

## Boolean Vectors {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# Just a vector of true or false values
# These can be used to index into vectors
n = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
m = c(TRUE, FALSE)
v = 1:4
```

## Boolean Vectors {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# What is the output of both?
# Which of these uses recycling?
v[m]
v[n]
# The first one uses recycling, because length(v) is 4
# but length(m) is 2
```

## Boolean Vectors {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# Use sequence to create an identical variable
c(1:100)[c(c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), c(FALSE, FALSE))]

# Answer:
seq(1,100,5)

# A boolean vector is created that then is used to index 
# the vector c(1:100)
```

## Recycling {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# What is the result of this expression?
1:2 * 1:4

# Answer:
# The first vector is recycled, so the result is c(1,4,3,8)

# What is the result of this expression?
1:2 * 1:5

# This runs, but also creates a warning
```

## Vector Operations {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

# Re-write the above vector in a cleaner way
1:10

# What will be the content of y?
x = 1:10
y = x + 5

# This is a vectorized operation, so 5 gets added 
# to ALL the values in x, and x becomes c(6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)
```

## Vectorized vs. Aggregate Functions {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
x = 1:10
sqrt(x)
mean(x)
min(x)
max(x)
```

## Vectorized vs. Aggregate Functions {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# What will be the result of this expression?
mean(x) < 5
# How about this one?
mean(x < 5)
# What's the result of the intermediate step above?
x < 5
```

## Vectorized vs. Aggregate Functions {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# Remember, when aggregator functions are called on boolean
# vectors, the values are converted to 1 or 0
v = c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE)
# What is the output of this expression?
sum(v)
# And this one?
sqrt(v)
```

## Data Frames (Using Indices) {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# Using the built in mtcars data frame
# How do you get the all rows but just columns 3 to 5?
dat = mtcars[,3:5]
dat
```

## Data Frames (Using Column Names) {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# How about if we want column names?
dat = mtcars[,c("cyl","hp")]
dat
```

## Data Frames {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# How about the same as before, but only rows 1 to 5?
dat = mtcars[1:5,c("cyl","hp")]
dat
```

## Data Frames {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# Add the mpg column but only show rows where mpg > 20?
dat = mtcars[mtcars$mpg > 20,c("cyl","hp","mpg")]
dat
```

## Data Frames {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# We're using a boolean vector to index the rows
mtcars$mpg > 20
# This shows which rows to include, and which rows to ignore
```

## CSV to Plot {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# Read the CSV
dat_raw = read.csv("data/quizReview.csv")
dat_raw
```

## CSV to Plot {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# Remove the first column, which is just a timestamp
dat = dat_raw[,-1]

# Convert all values to either a 1 or a 0
dat[] = ifelse (dat == "I can make it!", 1,  0)

dat
```

## CSV to Plot {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# Check to see if all columns are now numeric
sapply(dat, class)

# Change the names of the columns (gsub wasn't covered in class)
names(dat) = gsub("[.]", " ", names(dat))

# Show the number of "I can make it!" votes for each day
sapply(dat, sum)
```

## CSV to Plot {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE }
# Sorting that vector
vect_of_times = sort(sapply(dat, sum), decreasing = TRUE)
vect_of_times
```

## CSV to Plot {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3 }
# plot the named vector of times
par(mar = c(4, 11, 2, 1), mgp = c(9,1,0))
barplot(
  vect_of_times, las = 1,horiz = TRUE, col = "red",
  ylab = "Day and Time", main = "Num People Avaliable for Each Time"
)
```

## Other Types of Plots (Histogram) {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3 }
hist(
  mtcars$mpg, 
  main = "Histogram of MPG Frequency", xlab = "MPG"
)
```

## Other Types of Plots (Line) {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3 }
x = sample(1:10, 10, TRUE) # vector of random values
plot(
  x, type="b",
  main = "Random Numbers in a Vector", xlab = "Index", ylab = "Random Value"
)
```

## Other Types of Plots (Scatter) {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3 }
plot(
  mtcars$disp, mtcars$mpg,
  main = "Mileage for Displacement", xlab = "Displacement", ylab = "MPG"
)
```

## Other Types of Plots (Scatter) {.build}

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3 }
# a different way to do the same thing
plot(
  mpg ~ disp, data=mtcars, col="red", pch=19,
  main = "Mileage for Displacement", xlab = "Displacement", ylab = "MPG"
)
```
